   <div class="abstract">
   <p>Title of the talk: Neoteric Frontiers in Cloud, Edge, and Quantum Computing</p>
    <center> <img src="Images/1.JPG"></center>
   <p>Abstract: Computing is being transformed into a model consisting of services that are delivered in a manner similar to utilities such as water, electricity, gas, and telephony. In such a model, users access services based on their requirements without regard to where the services are hosted or how they are delivered. The Cloud computing paradigm has turned this vision of “computing utilities” into a reality. It offers infrastructure, platform, and software as services, which are made available to consumers as subscription-oriented services. Cloud application platforms need to offer (1) APIs and tools for the rapid creation of elastic applications and (2) a runtime system for the deployment of applications on geographically distributed Data Centre infrastructures (with Quantum computing nodes) in a seamless manner.
      The Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm enables seamless integration of cyber-and-physical worlds and opens opportunities for creating a new class of applications for domains such as smart cities, smart robotics, and smart healthcare. The emerging Fog/Edge computing paradigms support latency-sensitive/real-time IoT applications with seamless integration of network-wide resources all the way from edge to the Cloud.
      This keynote presentation will cover (a) the 21st-century vision of computing and identifies various IT paradigms promising to deliver the vision of computing utilities; (b) innovative architecture for creating elastic Clouds integrating edge resources and managed Clouds, (c) Aneka 5G, a Cloud Application Platform, for rapid development of Cloud/Big Data applications and their deployment on private/public Clouds with resource provisioning driven by SLAs, (d) a novel FogBus software framework with Blockchain-based data-integrity management for facilitating end-to-end IoT-Fog/Edge-Cloud integration for the execution of sensitive IoT applications, (e) experimental results on deploying Cloud and Big Data/ IoT applications in engineering, and health care (e.g., COVID-19), deep learning/Artificial intelligence (AI), satellite image processing, and natural language processing (mining COVID-19 research literature for new insights) on elastic Clouds, (f) QFaaS: A Serverless Function-as-a-Service Framework for Quantum Computing, and (g) directions for delivering our 21st-century vision along with pathways for future research in Cloud and Edge/Fog computing.</p>
